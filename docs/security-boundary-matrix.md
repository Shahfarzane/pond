# Security boundary matrix

Pond stores Library data in plaintext and has no Library password or locked state. The boundaries below protect application access and validate external input.

| Boundary | Required behavior | Verification evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Renderer IPC | Accept trusted senders and validate typed query inputs | IPC sender and query validation tests |
| `pond://` | Resolve media within the permitted Library paths and reject path traversal | Protocol path validation and media storage tests |
| Local HTTP API | Require the local token and validate requests; retain preview tokens for reviewed mutations | HTTP route and operation tests |
| MCP | Respect configured access capabilities and use reviewed mutation operations | MCP and Agent operation access tests |
| Agent | Restrict discoverable operations and review mutations before execution | Agent review and replay-prevention tests |
| Native host | Validate framed messages and retain local socket permissions; from the offline inbox, dispatch only saves, without cookies, and read only regular files inside it | Native RPC, framing, server, native host, and offline inbox tests |
| Auxiliary windows | Validate the Save before opening, scope control messages to the owning window, and close during Library transitions | Preview-window tests |
| Imports | Validate paths and preserve supported external representations | Import and package fixtures |
| Exports | Write plaintext packages and files only to the requested export destination | Package and export tests |
| Background work | Stop admission and drain in-flight work before changing the active Library | Library lifecycle, executor, and queue tests |
| Provider credentials | Keep provider secrets in main and operating system secure storage | Keychain and provider tests |

Run the documented `pnpm check` and `pnpm build` checks. Before signing installers, also run `pnpm --filter @pond/desktop smoke:library-trust`, `pnpm --filter @pond/desktop smoke:offline-release`, and the built desktop smoke using isolated Libraries. The Library trust smoke checks backup manifests and reports password-protected folders in imported Eagle metadata; it does not add folder locking to Pond.
